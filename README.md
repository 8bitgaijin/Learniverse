## Usage

In Learniverse, players answer a series of questions designed to help them master core mental math skills. Each correct answer rewards the player with an image of a cat, and perfect scores unlock a bonus game. The goal is to provide a fun and interactive learning experience with simple and intuitive controls.

### Custom Music
You are encouraged to replace the existing music files with your own tracks. You can generate new tracks via **Suno** or use any legally owned MP3s. Simply place your custom MP3s in the appropriate subfolder in the `/assets/music/` directory.

### Custom Art
You can also replace the existing artwork with your own. You can create new images using tools like **Stable Diffusion** (as the developer does), or use any 16:9 JPG or PNG files. To replace the art, simply place your custom images in the appropriate subfolder in the `/assets/art/` directory.
